#summary How to report errors
= Introduction to Android System Log =

If My Tracks fails in any way, it is important to capture the system log.  Every Android phone has a circular log of system events.  All applications can put messages in it. My Tracks logs important events like crashes in this log.  If you can capture your system log when My Tracks fails, it can help us improve the product.

= How to Capture System Log =

Use a log collector app from the Play Store like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xtralogic.android.logcollector.

The system log is circular, thus it is important that you capture the log shortly after an error occurs, otherwise, the data will get overwritten by new log messages.

Once you have captured the log, please file a new issue at http://code.google.com/p/mytracks/issues/entry. Due to the sensitive nature of the log, you can just include the My Tracks messages from it.

Sorry for anyone who is experiencing errors. Please help us make the app even better by sending us detailed logs.
